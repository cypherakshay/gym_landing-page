## **Zoovier Gym** - Landing Page `(static page)`

&nbsp;

> ## **Project Description**

&nbsp;

This project is a gym landing page that contains a form for lead details. In this project, I learned to create a form with HTML and put a background image, and use of CSS property to get navbar with hover-button. I learned to use creativity with code and some basics of CSS, which makes the task very easier.
 

&nbsp;

I write the code with the proper comments to understand its reference easily to the other coder and also this page is not mobile responsive cause I am learning the execution of code, I want to inculcate the basics first.
